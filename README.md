Koheron Server provides routes towards commands defined as C++ functions. Commands are remotely accessed using TCP and/or Websocket protocol(s).

High performance is achieved by compiling into a single executable the user defined commands with the native support for TCP/Websocket protocols.

A reference implementation for the client is provided in Python: https://github.com/Koheron/koheron-python.

See the [documentation](https://www.koheron.com/software-development-kit/documentation/server) to learn more.
